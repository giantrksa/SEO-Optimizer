This repository contains a simple Python function that you can use to make requests to OpenAI's GPT model. It can be useful for a variety of tasks like generating copy, providing an analysis of text, or even as a basis for a chatbot!

## Requirements

Before running the function, you need to install the OpenAI Python library. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Also, you'll need to obtain your OpenAI API key, which you can get from your account settings on the OpenAI website.

## Using the Function

Below is the Python function that you can use to make requests to the GPT model.

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

def chat_gpt_request(prompt, model="text-davinci-002", tokens=250, temperature=0.7):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model,
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=tokens,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=temperature,
        top_p=1
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

### Parameters

- `prompt`: The text you want the model to respond to.
- `model`: The ID of the model you want to use (default is `"text-davinci-002"`).
- `tokens`: The maximum number of tokens in the output (default is 250).
- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values produce more diverse outputs (default is 0.7).

## Examples

Here is an example usage of the function, where it is used to generate a response from the GPT model:

```python
content = "As we celebrate International Women's Day..."
prompt = "Please give a detailed analysis for improvement and rate the content..."

response = chat_gpt_request(prompt)
print(response)
```

You can also use this function to create copy writing content:

```python
idea = 'master card visa in international woman day'
prompt = "Create copy writing content about:\n\n" + idea

response = chat_gpt_request(prompt)
print(response)
```

In the end, enjoy creating with the OpenAI API! Whether you're interested in generating text, analyzing content, or designing a chatbot, the possibilities are endless. Make sure to share your interesting creations with us!
